# ABO Vs HBB

## Introduction

From already conducted analysis of both the
[ABO](https://github.com/Astro0re/Bioinformatics/blob/main/ABO%20gene%20analysis.md)
and
[HBB](https://github.com/Astro0re/Bioinformatics/blob/main/HBB%20gene%20analysis.md)
genes this report takes a look at the two genes in comparison, to
identify similarities and differences and make possible discoveries of
any factors affecting or leading to the production of both. This report
will be looking at both the sequencial and structural make up of both
genes and their variants using common bioinformatics tools such as
Ugene, Pymol etc.
