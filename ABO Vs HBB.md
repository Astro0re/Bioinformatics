## Introduction
From already conducted analysis of both the ABO and HBB genes this report takes a look at the two genes in comparison, to identify similarities and diffrences and make possible discoveries of any factors affecting or leading to the production of both. 
This report will be looking at both the sequencial and structural make up of both genes and their varriants using common bioinformatics tools such as Ugene, Pymol etc.
