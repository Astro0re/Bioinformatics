# ABO Gene

## Introduction

This analysis is to take a deep dive into the features and properties of
the Blood type determining gene factor, Using Bioinformatics tools to
compare and analyse this gene, looking into it's sequencial and
structural make up, as well as looking at possible mutations and it's
effects.

Gene gotten form the National Center of Biotechnology Institute (NCBI) 
## Sequence
General information about the sequence ie location, size 
## Gene Prediction
Using Softberry web service (Operon and gene finding menue- fgenesB) taking 

## Variants
Varitaions in the sequence leading to the different types of Blood groups occur in the -- region of the gene 
## 3D Structure
3D structure done using chimera bioinformatics tool
