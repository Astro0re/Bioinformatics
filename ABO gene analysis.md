# ABO Gene

## Introduction

This analysis is to take a deep dive into the features and properties of
the Blood type determining gene factor the ABO Gene, Using Bioinformatics tools to
compare and analyse this gene, looking into it's sequencial and
structural make up, as well as looking at possible mutations and it's
effects.

Gene sequence gotten from the [National Center of Biotechnology information (NCBI)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
## Sequence
General information about the sequence ie location, size 
The ABO gene discoverd about 100 years ago, has been of great importance to the understanding and application of inherited characteristic and potential immunogenic impact during transfusions(Dean, 2005).
Located on the 9th chromosome and a lenght of 24801
## Gene Prediction
Using Softberry web service (Operon and gene finding menue- fgenesB) taking 
Running this program certain information can be found out, on such information is that the gene posseses (25 transcription units with 4 Operons), 6 Exons for the 6 coding sequences present with varrying lenghts of 57 - 690

## Variants
Varitaions in the sequence leading to the different types of Blood groups occur in the regulatory elements of transcription of the gene , through the efort of many scientist various alleles of the ABO gene has been discovered some including A1,A2,B,O etc (Yamamoto, 2021).

## Secondary Structure
The secondary structures of this gene will be predicted using the USCF Chimera program 

## 3D Structure
