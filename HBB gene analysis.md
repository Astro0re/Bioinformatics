# HBB gene

## Introduction

This gene responsible for the production of Hemoglobin is a major
determinant of potential susceptibility to different diseases based on
the resulting hemogloibin shape or features, this report analyses the
sequencial and structural information to gain a better understanding of
the genes, the physiological effect and the potential damages that may
be caused by mutations to these genes.
