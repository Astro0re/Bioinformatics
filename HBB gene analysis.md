# HBB gene
## Introduction
This gene resposible for the production of Hemoglobin is a major determinant of potential suceptibility to diffrent diseases based on the resulting hemogloibin shape or features, this report analyses the sequencecial and structural information to gain a better understanding of the genes, the pysiological effect and the potential damages that may be caused by mutations to these genes.
