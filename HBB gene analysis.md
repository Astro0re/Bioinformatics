# HBB gene

## Introduction

This gene responsible for the production of Hemoglobin is a major
determinant of potential susceptibility to different diseases based on
the resulting hemogloibin shape or features, this report analyses the
sequencial and structural information to gain a better understanding of
the genes, the physiological effect and the potential damages that may
be caused by mutations to these genes.

Gene sequence gotten from the [National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
## Sequence
The HBB gene also known as the hemoglobin encoding gene, made up of four polypetide chains of globin fond in as a tetameric molecule in the red blood cells(Ejaz et al., 2023).
Mutations in this gene is responsible for hemoglobinopathies(Diesease of the Globin cells) such as sickel cell anemia and thalassemia which has resulted into studies to understand it's molecular mehcanism to find possible solutions (Carlice-dos-Reis et al., 2017).

## Gene Prediction

## Variants
So far there have been 36 variants discoverd and more possible mutations yet to be discovered, mutations often caused by a change in the sequnece (Aldakeel et al, 2020)

## Secondary Structures
The secondary structures of these genes will be predicted using the USCF Chimera program 

## 3D Structure
Visualized using PYMol Application
